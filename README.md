# song-playlist
This project is an simple improvement to a cpp class project that I did for CSCI 235. The following files were provided by my CSCI 235 professor Tiziana Ligorio: LinkedSet.cpp, LinkedSet.h, Node.cpp, Node.h, SetInterface.h. Original authors are appropriately credited within the heading of these files.
Note: This program does not actually play audio like in a real playlist but rather it would imitate a simple song playlist and its basic functions such as add, remove, loop, unloop, and display.

# Changes Made
In the original project, the program only allowed for test mains and does not allow for user input. So the biggest change I made was to allow for user input and included an interactive menu. Still retaining the basic linked set data structure, besides the files mentioned above, every other file are original.

# Running the Program
Place all the files in a directory and open the directory in your Terminal. Use "make" to compile all the files and get the new "hello" file. Use "./hello" to start the program. Finally, use the menu provided to perform the action you want.
